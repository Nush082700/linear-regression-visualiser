A. MACHINE LEARNING MODEL
- The user should be able to mention which is the target variable
- Should I encode categorical data or remove them completely
- The python programme should be able to iterate through all columns and fill in the NaN values(with a constant or mean or median)
    1. For the above we can see if the values are continuous or discrete
    2. If continuous, fill with median() else fill with a constant value like 0
- It should also be able to find the index of the column and make it the target variable whereas all the others will be training variables
-Then it should train the model 
- find the AUC using numpy
    1. This is found by TPR against FPR for various threshold values
    2. FPR = 1 - sensitivity
    3. To calculate TPR:
        a. iterate over the actual array and predicted array
        b. Count the times that the predicted array has 1 when the actual array has 1
- Alternative way: Use pandas to get confusion matrix (Ask if this is okay)
- Visualize it using an external library

B. FRONT_END
- The user should be able to upload a csv (maybe excel file)
- The server should eventually store it in the same file as the main file 
(not a good idea but should work for now. Can we save it in C drive? - Path problems might arise)
- On submit, it should go to the app route of predictions which will remove everything and just show the graph
- There should be a button to help transition between the web pages
